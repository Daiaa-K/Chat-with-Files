      "\n",
      "*   **Sunlight:** Sunlight is actually made up of all the colors of the rainbow.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Entering the Atmosphere:** When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with tiny air molecules (mostly nitrogen and oxygen).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Scattering:** This collision causes the light to scatter in different directions.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Rayleigh Scattering:** Rayleigh scattering is the scattering of electromagnetic radiation (of which light is a form) by particles of a much smaller wavelength.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Wavelength Matters:** Shorter wavelengths of light (blue and violet) are scattered more strongly than longer wavelengths (red and orange). The amount of scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. This means that blue light is scattered about four times more than red light.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Why Not Violet?** Violet light is scattered even more than blue light. However, there are two reasons why the sky appears blue instead of violet:\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Sunlight Intensity:** The sun emits slightly less violet light than blue light.\n",
      "    *   **Our Eyes:** Our eyes are also more sensitive to blue light than violet light.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The Result:** Because blue light is scattered more and our eyes are more sensitive to it, we see the sky as blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary:** Shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) of sunlight are scattered more than other colors by the atmosphere. Since our eyes are more sensitive to blue and there's slightly more blue light emitted by the sun, we perceive the sky as blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Think of it like this:** Imagine throwing a handful of marbles (blue and red) at a field of tiny pebbles. The smaller blue marbles are more likely to bounce off in different directions than the larger red marbles.\n",
